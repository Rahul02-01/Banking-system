# Banking-system
This is Java project using JDBC and MYSQL...For more description please check README

This is the complete command line program that deals with the work done by a bank (i.e manager and customer)...
I used the JAVA, JDBC, MYSQL knowledge to make this project...
To use this project without making any changes please create two database respectively for manager and customer and also make tables naming manager_data(columns are man_id and man_pass ) and customer_data(columns are acc_num , acc_name , acc_pin , acc_amount) in the respective databases..
And if you want to create your own names then please do make minute changes...
Thank you
